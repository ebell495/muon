**Note:** This document mostly contains some details omitted from the [**original presentation**](https://bit.ly/muon-present)

## TYPES

- Primitive:
  - **String**
  - **Typed**: integer and float numbers
  - **Special**: `True`, `False`, `Null`, `NaN`, `-Inf`, `+Inf`
- Composite:
  - **TypedArray** - array of elements of the same type, possibly chunked
  - **List** - ordered sequence of arbitrary objects
  - **Dict** - ordered associative container of key-value pairs

#### String

`0x81` reference to a string in an LRU list, counting from top  
`0x82` fixed-length string. `len` is in **bytes**. Useful when encoding:
- long strings (>=512 bytes)
- strings that contain `null characters (0x00)`

#### Integer

`0xA0..0xA9` - single-digit integers (for short encoding)  
`0xB0..0xB7` - typed integers (Little-Endian)  
`0xBB` - LEB128 encoded integers

#### Float

`0xB8` - float16, `0xB9` - float32, `0xBA` - float64 (all are Little-Endian)

#### Special value

```c
0xAA  False
0xAB  True
0xAC  Null/None
0xAD  NaN
0xAE  -Inf
0xAF  +Inf
```

#### TypedArray

`0x84` - `TypedArray`  
`0x85` - chunked `TypedArray`. the `count`+`values` sequence is repeated until a zero-length chunk

#### List

A sequence of arbitrary Muon objects

#### Dict

- Dictionary is ordered by default
- Duplicate keys are **not** allowed
- Keys can be `Integer` or `String`
- All keys must be of the same type (i.e. all strings or all ints)
  - Mixing different string encodings is explicitly allowed
- For integer keys:
  - Typed integer (`0xB0..0xB7` or `0xBB`) encoding is used for the first key
  - All subsequent keys must be of the same type and type specifier (`0xBx`) is omitted for them
  - `special` encoding for integers must **not** be used for keys

## TAGS

Tags are encoded using a single byte (marked dark green), possibly followed by some payload. Multiple tags can be applied to an object.

#### `0x8A` Count

Specifies size of the following structure in **elements**.  
This tag can optionally be added to enable parser optimizations.
When applied to `String`, this tag indicates the count of unicode characters (not length in bytes).

Payload: `LEB128`  
Applies to: `Dict`, `List`, `String`

#### `0x8B` Size

Specifies size of the following structure in **bytes** (excluding any tags applied to it).  
This tag can optionally be added to enable optimized document scanning.

Payload: `LEB128`  
Applies to: `Dict`, `List`, `TypedArray`

#### `0x8C` Referenced String

Instructs that the following string needs to be added to the LRU string list.

Payload: none  
Applies to: `String`, `List`

Notes:
1. Once the list is full, items are discarded from the beginning
2. If applied to a String Reference (type `0x81`), associated string is moved to the top of the LRU list

#### `0x8F` Muon Format Signature/Magic

Can be used at the start of a file or stream and allows the reader to [more reliably guess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures) that Muon format is used.

Payload: `B5 30 31` which is `ISO 8859-1` encoding of `Î¼01` (`Greek Small Letter Mu` + `version`, currently always 1)  
Applies to: usually only appears at the beginning of file/stream, once. In case of concatenated/chained objects it can appear multiple times.

#### `0xFF` Padding

Can be used to align the following value in memory, or as stream keep-alive signal.

Payload: none  
Applies to: anything

## DETERMINISTIC ENCODING

Muon Encoder can optimize it's output, selecting from multiple available encodings for the same value.  
Sometimes, it's desired to have a deterministic encoding, where the same structure maps to the same binary output.  
Specificly, for deterministic muon: `muon_generate(muon_parse(original_bytes)) == original_bytes`.  

For creating a deterministic Muon, follow the following rules:

- **String:**
  - must have a valid and deterministic encoding in UTF8 (out of scope for this document)
  - must be encoded as fixed-length if:
    - length >= 512 bytes, or
    - contains `0x00` bytes
  - string references:
    - `0x8C` tag must **not** be applied to any strings
    - `0x8C` tag can only apply to a single, static LRU list that apperas only once at the begining of the Muon document
    - if present, LRU list must be preserved when re-encoding
    - all strings that are present in LRU list must be encoded in string ref (`0x81`) format
  - 0-terminated format is used in all other cases

- **Integer:**
  - `0..9` must use special encoding (`0xA0..0xA9`)
  - LEB128 encoding (`0xBB`) is used for all other standalone integers
- **Float:**
  - `NaN`, `-Inf`, `+Inf` must be encoded using special encoding (`0xAD..0xAF`)
  - float64 (`0xBA`) format is used in all other cases
- **TypedArray:**
  - must preserve their type when re-encoding
- **Dict:**
  - is ordered
  - must preserve key type
- **Tags:**
  - `count`,`size`,`padding` tags must **not** be used
  - magic tag `0x8F` must be ignored when comparing deterministic documents (i.e. may be present or missing)

## CHAINING

Muon is entirely self-contained, so decoder will read one object at a time. Therefore, to decode multiple concatenated objects, you should repeatedly call a decoder until you reach end of file or stream. Even if LRU strings list is used, the way it is referenced still produces the correct result. Whenever possible, tools and libraries should provide ways of working with concatenated objects. If for any reason it makes no sense in a specific application context, any data (except padding tag `0xFF`) that follows the first root object should be treated as an error.

For communication protocols, the following encoding is recommended:
- stream begins with a Muon `magic` tag (recommended, optional) and `0x90` (start list)
- then a bunch of objects are sent one after another (decoder is called in a loop)
- `0xFF` (padding) can be used as a keepalive signal
- `0x91` (list end) is an explicit end of stream, after which connection should be cleanly terminated
